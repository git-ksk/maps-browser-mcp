# Container / headless Linux

`maps-browser-mcp` can run in a standard Linux container with Chromium installed. This is intended for bounded, single-user, self-hosted use; it is not a hosted Maps data API, crawler, or multi-tenant scraping service.

## Build

```bash
docker build -t maps-browser-mcp .
```

The image:

- runs as a non-root `mcp` user
- uses `/usr/bin/chromium`
- enables headless mode
- uses the dedicated ephemeral profile `/tmp/maps-browser-mcp/chrome-profile`
- starts the Streamable HTTP transport
- keeps the application's normal loopback bind default unless you explicitly override it

## Run locally through a published container port

A process bound to `127.0.0.1` inside a container is not reachable through a published host port. To publish the MCP endpoint, explicitly opt in to non-loopback binding and configure a strong application bearer token:

```bash
TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"

docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
  -e MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_ALLOW_NONLOOPBACK=true \
  -e MCP_BEARER_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
  maps-browser-mcp
```

Keep the published host port on loopback when possible and place authenticated HTTPS/TLS infrastructure in front if a remote MCP client needs access. Configure `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for the exact public routing setup when needed.

Do not expose the Chrome DevTools/CDP port.

## Port selection

HTTP port precedence is:

1. `MCP_HTTP_PORT`
2. `PORT`
3. `8787`

`PORT` exists only as a generic runtime fallback. `MCP_HTTP_PORT` remains the project-specific configuration and takes precedence whenever both are present.

## Browser profile

The image defaults to an ephemeral dedicated profile:

```text
/tmp/maps-browser-mcp/chrome-profile
```

Override it with `MAPS_CHROME_PROFILE_DIR` only when you have a specific single-user persistence requirement. Never point the server at an everyday browser profile, and never share one profile across concurrent users or instances.

## Health check

`GET /healthz` returns a small local process-health response and does not access Google Maps or start a browser operation. Treat it as HTTP-process liveness, not as proof that the live Google Maps UI is reachable.

The image includes a container `HEALTHCHECK` using this endpoint.

## Shutdown

The HTTP process handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`, closes the MCP handler, shuts down the managed browser runtime, closes idle HTTP connections, and then exits. This keeps container shutdown aligned with the normal server lifecycle.

## Security notes

The normal safety invariants remain in force in containers:

- default bind address remains loopback
- non-loopback binding requires `MCP_ALLOW_NONLOOPBACK=true`
- non-loopback binding also requires a bearer token of at least 24 characters
- external CDP attachment remains opt-in
- V3 visible-state reading remains opt-in
- Maps-derived text remains untrusted external data
- CAPTCHA, sign-in, consent, and access challenges are not bypassed

Containerization does not change the project's Google Maps usage boundaries or terms-of-service considerations.
